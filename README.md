# single-spa-errors

> :warning: **Moved** to https://github.com/daniloesk/single-spa-examples

Code to reproduce [single-spa](https://github.com/single-spa) project and sub-projects errors.
Errors can also result in fix or workaround examples.
Also hosts working examples for solutions to common requirements.

* Reproducing scenarios links posted on issues are tags with the pattern
  `<subproject>#<issue>(-<evolution>)`.
* Branches with prefixes (e.g. bugfix) follow error fixing evolution.
* Branches with no prefix are building blocks for error scenarios (e.g. root, angular10, angular11).
* I will destroy and rebuild block branches as needed.

**Follow git log** to see each step used to build the scenario and understand the reason for each
change.
I am no longer building a summary doc since it is more work than building the example itself.

For the same reason I am not including error documentation here anymore.
All the required information should be in the issue I linked this code from.
